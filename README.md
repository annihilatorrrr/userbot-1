### Hooks (triggers)

Triggers can be enabled by `.<hookname>here` and disabled by `.no<hookname>here`. They are disabled
everywhere by default. To check if a hook is enabled or disabled, use `.hookshere`.

- `emojis`:
  - Sends a duck emoji (🦆) when someone writes "дак" (pronounced as "duck") or "кря"
    (pronounces as "krya", English equivalent is "quack")
  - Sends a pancake emoji (🥞) when someone writes "блин" (English equivalent is "pancake", also
    that's how Russian equivalent to the English "f*ck" is "censored")
- `tap`: Sends a sticker with a finger touching a seal when someone writes "тык" or sends that
  sticker itself
- `mibib`: Sends a sticker (with 20% chance) with an animated pixelated bear when someone sends that
  sticker itself

## Installation and running

1. Copy the following to `config.yaml` and modify for yourself:
    ```yaml
    session: karych # Name for session file
    api_id: ""  # Insert your Telegram api_id here
    api_hash: ""  # Insert your Telegram api_hash here
    kwargs:  # Optional, will be passed directly to `pyrogram.Client`, see docs for more info
      phone_number: "+1234567890"
      # ...
    data_location: /data  # Data location
    ```
2. Make sure docker is installed, then run `docker-compose build`.
3. Go through interactive authentication (needed only once as `/data` is mounted as docker volume)
  by running `docker-compose run --rm main python -m userbot`.
4. Stop the script by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> as soon as you see `Bot started` message
  in console.
5. Run `docker-compose up -d` to run the userbot in the background.
